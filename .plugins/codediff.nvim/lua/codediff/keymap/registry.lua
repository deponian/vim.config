-- Per-session keymap registry.
--
-- Owns every mapping a single codediff session installs, so teardown is
-- symmetric with setup. The registry holds no mapping state itself: it records
-- which slots it claimed and delegates arbitration to codediff.keymap.slots.
--
-- Buffer ownership matters for suspend/resume:
--   * borrowed buffers (real files shown in the diff panes) must release their
--     mappings when the user leaves the tab, or codediff's keys would appear
--     on that file everywhere it is opened;
--   * owned buffers (explorer/history panels and other codediff scratch
--     buffers) cannot leak anywhere, so their mappings stay installed until
--     the buffer goes away. Suspending them caused a past regression where
--     panel keys vanished after a tab switch.
