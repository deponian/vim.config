-- Global mapping-slot arbiter.
--
-- A "slot" is one concrete Neovim mapping: (bufnr, mode, canonical lhs).
-- Every slot remembers the buffer-local mapping that existed before codediff
-- first touched it, and the set of claims currently competing for it.
--
-- Invariants:
--   * The pre-existing mapping is snapshotted exactly once, on first claim.
--   * It is handed back when the last claim is released.
--   * If no buffer-local mapping existed, codediff's mapping is deleted so the
--     global/default binding becomes visible again.
--   * If another plugin replaces codediff's mapping while it is installed, the
--     foreign mapping wins: codediff neither reinstalls nor restores over it.
--
-- Multiple sessions may claim the same slot (the same real file can be open in
-- two diff tabs). Claims are reference-counted so teardown of one session
-- cannot destroy another session's mapping or the user's original.
