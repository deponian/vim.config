--- Display a real-file buffer in a window, re-syncing it with disk first.
---
--- Neovim runs a timestamp check whenever a buffer becomes visible. When the
--- file was deleted behind our back (branch switch, `git stash`, external `rm`)
--- that check emits `E211: File ... no longer available`; worse, it can surface
--- as an error out of `nvim_win_set_buf` and abort view construction halfway.
---
--- Running the check ourselves beforehand reloads the buffer when the file
--- really did change and clears the pending check either way, so the display
--- below stays quiet. `:checktime {buf}` is scoped to this buffer — a bare
--- `:checktime` walks every loaded buffer and would reload unrelated files.
--- `silent!` is required on top of `pcall`: for a buffer that is (or is about
--- to be) displayed, `:checktime` *reports* `E211` rather than raising it, so
--- `pcall` alone does not suppress it. A missing file has nothing to reload;
--- the deletion is picked up by the refresh that follows.

--- Load a real file into a buffer and display it in `win`.

--- Uses `:edit` rather than `bufload()` for a not-yet-loaded buffer on purpose:
--- a buffer loaded outside of any window and then displayed comes back marked
--- `'modified'`, which makes Neovim refuse to ever reload it from disk (W12).
---
--- When the buffer already exists it is reused as-is: `bufadd` resolves
--- `target` to the exact buffer Neovim would pick even when the path is spelled
--- differently (a symlinked directory such as macOS `/tmp`, a `./` segment),
--- which is precisely the case where `:edit` would fail with `E211` for a file
--- that has since been deleted.
